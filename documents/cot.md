# Understanding Chain of Thought (CoT), Chain of Decision (CoD), and Chain of Draft

When capturing AI outputs or any structured decision-making data, it's important to select the appropriate method to best suit your use case. The three common structures are Chain of Thought, Chain of Decision, and Chain of Draft. Each captures information differently, serving distinct purposes.

---

## 1. Chain of Thought (CoT)

### Definition:
Chain of Thought captures the detailed step-by-step reasoning behind each decision or conclusion. It illustrates how a decision was reached, providing clear interpretability and context.

### Ideal Use Cases:
- Auditing complex AI decisions
- Troubleshooting and debugging
- Transparent AI decision-making

### Example Structure:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"thought": "Market shows bullish indicators (MACD crossover)."},
    {"thought": "Trading volume supports bullish sentiment."},
    {"decision": "Execute buy order for XRP."}
  ]
}
```

## 2. Chain of Decision (CoD)

### Definition:
Chain of Decision emphasizes concise logging of the decision points themselves without extensive detail of intermediate reasoning. It succinctly tracks outcomes, timestamps, and key actions.

### Ideal Use Cases:
- High-level decision tracking
- Concise logging for quick audits
- Scenarios where detailed reasoning is unnecessary or too verbose

### Example Structure:
```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {"decision": "Buy XRP", "timestamp": "2025-04-18T10:00:00Z"},
    {"decision": "Sell XRP", "timestamp": "2025-04-18T12:00:00Z"}
  ]
}
```

## 3. Chain of Draft

### Definition:
**Chain of Draft** tracks the iterative progression of outputs or creations (text, code, designs) as they evolve from initial concept to polished final product.

### Ideal Use Cases:
- Content generation
- Code iterations and version tracking
- Creative workflows

### Example Structure:
```json
{
  "drafts": [
    {"version": 1, "draft": "Initial concept and outline."},
    {"version": 2, "draft": "Expanded draft with examples."},
    {"version": 3, "draft": "Final refined and edited draft."}
  ]
}
```

## Summary of Key Differences

| Aspect                | Chain of Thought (CoT)         | Chain of Decision (CoD)          | Chain of Draft                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Detail Level      | High (Detailed reasoning)      | Low (Concise decisions)          | Iterative (Progression stages) |
| Interpretability**  | High                           | Medium (decision tracking only)  | Medium (version tracking)      |
| Best for          | Auditing & Debugging           | Quick Audits & Decision logging  | Iterative creative processes   |
